				<h2>Go eco-friendly this Ganesh Utsav and have a positive impact while doing it!</h2>
				<p>Every year with enormous apprehension we commemorate the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi. The celebration signifies the cycle of birth, life, and death. Lord Ganesha, who is also known as the lord of new beginnings, is also worshiped as the remover of obstacles.</br></br>

				The festival has four major rites that are conducted during the 10-day long festival. These are-- Pranapratishhtha, Shhodashopachara, Uttarpuja, and Ganpati Visarjan.<br></br>

				This festival is celebrated with incredible devotion and delight by Hindus throughout the world and essentially in Maharashtra, India.<br></br>

				But how will we be celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi this year while a deadly pandemic is prevailing around us?? Circumstances have changed in these few months and the festival can worsen the scenario if we celebrate it traditionally.<br></br>

				Hence, we need to adapt this style to hope for the day when we would finally come through this pandemic.<br></br></p>

				<h3>Celebrating the Eco-friendly Ganpati festival highly encourages you to act appropriately and observe festivals without mistreating the environment and the other living beings.</h3><br></br>

				<ul>
					<li>Using eco-friendly Ganesh idol made up of unbaked clay, coconut, etc., which can easily disposable and doesn’t harm the environment to a great extent.</li></br>
					<li>Limiting the size of the idol can also help in eco- friendly celebration as less amount of material would be used and less waste would be released in the environment.</li></br>
					<li>Another aspect is banning plastics for offering prasad and using the decomposable product to offer prasad.</li></br>
					<li>More and more eco-friendly ways should be developed and awareness should be spread among people which will have a positive effect on the environment.</li></br>
					<li>Immersion can also be done by sprinkling a few drops of water on the idol and then wiping it off and keeping it for next year’s use. Thus, it will be reusable resulting into less waste. </li></br>
					<li>Encourage your community for an artificial immersion tank instead of natural water sources like a river, lake, or pond. Using natural colors can also save fresh water.</li></br>
					<li>Also, competitions should be held between idol maker artists, who can make a more creatively and innovative eco-friendly idol of Lord Ganesh.</li></br>
					<li>Prizes should be distributed to communities that promote eco-friendly ways of celebrating festivals which will encourage others also to do this.</li></br>
					<li>And the artist can also use their creativity skill to next level by using natural colors to draw paintings and designs around the pond, river, tank, etc., which can be taken to a next level culture.
					</li></br>
